**How do I approach designing software?**

Understand the Problem: Begin by gaining a deep understanding of the problem you are trying to solve with the software. Identify the goals, requirements, and constraints of the project. This involves gathering information, conducting research, and potentially talking to stakeholders.

Define User Needs: Identify and analyze the needs of the users who will interact with the software. Understand their goals, preferences, and pain points. This information will guide the design decisions throughout the process.

Information Architecture: Organize the software's structure and layout. Create a coherent navigation system and ensure the information hierarchy is intuitive for users. Consider how different components and features will interact with each other.

Visual Design: Create the visual elements of the software, such as color schemes, typography, and graphical assets. Ensure consistency, readability, and accessibility in the visual design. Use style guides and design systems to maintain a unified look and feel.

**How do I approach developing programs?**

Understand the Requirements: Begin by thoroughly understanding the requirements of the program. Clarify any ambiguities or uncertainties by communicating with stakeholders or domain experts. This step is crucial to ensure you have a clear vision of what needs to be developed.

Plan and Design: Before writing any code, it's important to plan and design the architecture and structure of your program. Break down the requirements into smaller tasks and create a development plan or roadmap. Consider the design patterns, algorithms, and data structures that will be most suitable for your program.

Write Code: Implement the planned features by writing code in a programming language of your choice. Follow best coding practices, such as writing clean, modular, and maintainable code. Consider using version control systems to track changes and collaborate with other developers if applicable.

Test and Debug: Thoroughly test your code to ensure it behaves as expected. Write unit tests, integration tests, and any other necessary tests to validate the functionality of your program. Debug and fix any issues or errors that arise during testing.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

Computational graphics and visualization helped to open my one door to direct my career goals toward gaming industry. I am planning to go with software development but this can be helpful in future to switch towards Gaming.
